A BBQ add-on for Minetest.

Depends on (and expands upon) Mobs-Redo and it's animals add-ons.
Causes cows to drop beef and lambs to drop button.

Play's nice with Crops and Food addons. Can use tomatos, cheese, sugar, and honey from Crops, Food, and Mobs-Redo add-ons. Also compatible with my expansion of the Crops add-on (adds peppers, peppercorns, and ground pepper to the Crops add-on, all are present in this addon but without the actual pepper plant).

Upgrades the BTUs of wood and wood planks in a realistic way when used in furnaces (including the smoker).

All spices and sauces can be placed on the vessels shelf. Also added support for placing the bucket in the vessels shelf.
